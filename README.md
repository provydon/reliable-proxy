*A simple, reliable proxy service for accessing region-restricted APIs from anywhere in the world.*

## 🤔 Why Reliable Proxy?

I created this tool while working remotely from Nigeria for a US company, where I faced challenges accessing US-restricted APIs needed for my work. Many popular paid proxies suffer from reliability issues because their IPs get blocked by target services.

### ✨ Reliable Proxy solves this by allowing you to:

- 🚀 Deploy your own proxy in your target region
- 🔒 Access region-restricted APIs reliably
- 💸 Run it for free on platforms like Render

## 🚀 Quick Installation

### 1️⃣ Pre-built Binaries (Fastest Method)

```bash
# For Linux x86_64
curl -L https://github.com/provydon/reliable-proxy/releases/latest/download/reliable-proxy_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz -o reliable-proxy.tar.gz

# For Linux ARM64
curl -L https://github.com/provydon/reliable-proxy/releases/latest/download/reliable-proxy_Linux_arm64.tar.gz -o reliable-proxy.tar.gz

# For macOS Intel (x86_64)
curl -L https://github.com/provydon/reliable-proxy/releases/latest/download/reliable-proxy_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz -o reliable-proxy.tar.gz

# For macOS Apple Silicon (ARM64)
curl -L https://github.com/provydon/reliable-proxy/releases/latest/download/reliable-proxy_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz -o reliable-proxy.tar.gz

# For Windows x86_64
curl -L https://github.com/provydon/reliable-proxy/releases/latest/download/reliable-proxy_Windows_x86_64.zip -o reliable-proxy.zip

# For Windows ARM64
curl -L https://github.com/provydon/reliable-proxy/releases/latest/download/reliable-proxy_Windows_arm64.zip -o reliable-proxy.zip
```

```bash
# Extract and install (Linux/macOS)
tar -xzf reliable-proxy.tar.gz
chmod +x reliable-proxy
sudo mv reliable-proxy /usr/local/bin/

# Start the proxy
reliable-proxy
```

### 2️⃣ Using Docker

```bash
# Build and run
docker build -t reliable-proxy .
docker run -p 8080:8080 reliable-proxy
```

### 3️⃣ From Source

```bash
# Clone and enter the repository
git clone https://github.com/provydon/reliable-proxy.git && cd reliable-proxy

# Run directly
go run main.go
```

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Usage

> Note: `target-api-url` tells the proxy which API to forward requests to. You'll replace this with your own region-restricted API.

```bash
# Ready-to-use example (works immediately)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/" \
  -H "target-api-url: https://us-only-api.onrender.com" \
  -H "Accept: application/geo+json"

# With a default target (environment variable)
TARGET_API_URL="https://us-only-api.onrender.com" reliable-proxy
```

### Live Demo

```bash
# Example: Access a US-only API through our proxy 
# (returns JSON data from a geo-restricted API)
curl -X GET "https://reliable-proxy.onrender.com/" \
  -H "target-api-url: https://us-only-api.onrender.com" \
  -H "Accept: application/geo+json"
```

This demonstrates accessing geo-restricted content that would normally return an "Access Denied" error if accessed directly from outside the US.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🌎 **Region-specific deployment** for accessing geo-restricted APIs
- 🔄 **Full HTTP support** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- 📋 **Preserves headers and query parameters** 
- 🌐 **Auto region detection** with caching
- ⚙️ **Flexible configuration** via environment or headers

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you see `exec format error`, you downloaded the wrong binary for your system:

```bash
# Find your architecture
uname -m

# Download the correct version (example for macOS ARM64)
curl -L https://github.com/provydon/reliable-proxy/releases/latest/download/reliable-proxy_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz -o reliable-proxy.tar.gz
```
